Exec-ify
========

A module for shimmimg between execution modes: streams, promises, and callbacks

About
-----

Have you ever used a library that worked in callbacks when you wanted to work in promises?  Or did it want promises
and you just wanted a simple callback?  This library shims between callbacks, promises, and event streams.
Pass it a function that does any of the 3, and it'll return the results the way you wanted.

Usage
-----

```javascript
var execify = require('execify');

var functionToRun = function () {
  // this function could do anything:
  // - take a callback
  // - return a promise
  // - return a stream
  // - execute synchronously
};

// Return the results as a callback
execify.asCallback(functionToRun, ['optional','array','of','args'], function (err, results) {
  //...
});

// Return the results as a promise
var p = execify.asPromise(functionToRun, ['optional','array','of','args']);
p.then(function (results) {
  // success
}, function (err) {
  // fail
});

// Return the results as an event stream
var s = execify.asStream(functionToRun);
s.on('error', function (err) {
  // fail
});
s.on('end', function () {
  // done: good or bad
});
s.write(['optional','array','of','args']);
s.end();
```

Theory
------

How does it know what the `functionToRun` will do?

- It always appends a callback to the args you gave it
- It examines the results returned from the function
- Does the results have a `then` function? assume it's a promise, see [Promises/A+](http://promises-aplus.github.io/promises-spec/)
- Does the results have a `pipe` function, an `on` function, a `once` function, and an `end` function? assume it's a stream
- Does the function take in more parameters than you passed or was the callback called already? assume it's a callback
- If all else fails, assume synchronous

Does it change `this`?  No.

What if my `functionToRun` doesn't work this way? [let us know](https://github.com/robrich/execify/issues)

Fine print
----------

FRAGILE: Execify catches exceptions on sync runs to pass to your callback
but doesn't hook to process.uncaughtException so it can't pass those exceptions
to your callback
